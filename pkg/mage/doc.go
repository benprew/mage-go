// Package mage implements the two-player Magic: The Gathering rules engine in Go.
//
// # Subsystem Architecture and Ownership
//
// [Game] serves as the aggregate root and coordinator of the engine. Rather than
// implementing every domain rule directly, [Game] composes cohesive, stateful
// subsystems that each own their state invariants and cloning behavior:
//
//   - [ZoneSystem]: Owns battlefield storage with copy-on-write semantics for AI
//     search, exile storage with visibility metadata, entering-permanent tracking,
//     and Last-Known Information (LKI) snapshots.
//   - [TurnSystem]: Owns turn counters, current phase and step, active player
//     index, extra turns, [TurnSchedule] lifecycle, and one-shot untap restrictions.
//   - [ResolutionState]: Owns transient resolution scratch state including X values,
//     chosen modes, event source/amount context, cast-time snapshots ([CastContext]),
//     targets, damage/counter distributions, and cost payment reveals/sacrifices.
//   - [TriggerSystem]: Owns pending triggers waiting for stack placement, active
//     [DelayedTrigger] instances, and armed state triggers (CR 603.8).
//   - [ManaSystem]: Owns mana source discovery, mana ability solver planning,
//     and payment scratch buffers.
//   - [DamageSystem]: Owns damage execution, combat damage step aggregation,
//     damage history tracking, and damage reflection.
//   - [TrackerSystem]: Owns turn-scoped observations ([TurnTrackers]) and duel-scoped
//     observations ([DuelTrackers]).
//   - [RandomSource]: Owns deterministic integer and coin flip queues for tests
//     and AI simulation.
//
// In addition to these subsystems, [Game] coordinates the [Stack], [Combat],
// [EffectManager] (continuous and replacement effects), and [Player] instances.
//
// Read-only queries are organized into focused domain interfaces:
// [PlayerReader], [BattlefieldReader], [ResolutionReader], [TurnReader],
// [CombatReader], [TrackerReader], and [StackReader], which compose into [GameReader].
//
// # Engine Principles & Invariants
//
//   - Pure Queries: Readers and query methods never mutate game state or consume RNG.
//   - Clone Isolation: Cloned games ([Game.Clone]) must have strictly independent
//     state for tree search and AI simulation; mutations in one game never affect another.
//   - Transactional Cost Payments: Spell casting and ability activations verify and pay
//     costs atomically on an isolated clone before committing to the live game state.
//   - Durable Incarnations: Battlefield permanents track a unique incarnation ID
//     independent of their physical card UUID to prevent leave-and-return reference confusion.
//
// Draw-step replacements use [Static] with [SkipDrawStepForLife]. The rule
// follows the current controller and remains active only while the source has
// the ability. A pending gain keeps the player who skipped the step.
//
// Use [ManaValueOf] to read a permanent through its typed reference. Use
// [SnapshotNumber] before [Destroy] when a later instruction needs that value.
// The saved number remains available after the permanent leaves.
//
// [AttachedBecomesTapped] saves the event permanent before trigger placement.
// Read it with [From] so attachment changes cannot redirect the effect.
//
// Targeted destruction uses [Destroy] with a typed permanent target. Declare
// that target with [WithTargets] on the spell, mode, trigger, or activation.
// The target filter supplies the restriction; the action allows regeneration.
// Land destruction uses [IsLand] with the same target and action constructors.
// To destroy all lands, use [DestroyEach] with [MatchingPermanents] and [IsLand].
// The collection is selected at resolution and does not include phased permanents.
