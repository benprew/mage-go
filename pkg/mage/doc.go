// Package mage implements the two-player Magic: The Gathering rules engine in Go.
//
// # Subsystem Architecture and Ownership
//
// [Game] serves as the aggregate root and coordinator of the engine. Rather than
// implementing every domain rule directly, [Game] composes cohesive, stateful
// subsystems that each own their state invariants and cloning behavior:
//
//   - [ZoneSystem]: Owns battlefield storage with copy-on-write semantics for AI
//     search, exile storage with visibility metadata, entering-permanent tracking,
//     and Last-Known Information (LKI) snapshots.
//   - [TurnSystem]: Owns turn counters, current phase and step, active player
//     index, extra turns, [TurnSchedule] lifecycle, and one-shot untap restrictions.
//   - [ResolutionState]: Owns transient resolution scratch state including X values,
//     chosen modes, event source/amount context, cast-time snapshots ([CastContext]),
//     targets, damage/counter distributions, and cost payment reveals/sacrifices.
//   - [TriggerSystem]: Owns pending triggers waiting for stack placement, active
//     [DelayedTrigger] instances, and armed state triggers (CR 603.8).
//   - [ManaSystem]: Owns mana source discovery, mana ability solver planning,
//     and payment scratch buffers.
//   - [DamageSystem]: Owns damage execution, combat damage step aggregation,
//     damage history tracking, and damage reflection.
//   - [TrackerSystem]: Owns turn-scoped observations ([TurnTrackers]) and duel-scoped
//     observations ([DuelTrackers]).
//   - [RandomSource]: Owns deterministic integer and coin flip queues for tests
//     and AI simulation.
//
// In addition to these subsystems, [Game] coordinates the [Stack], [Combat],
// [EffectManager] (continuous and replacement effects), and [Player] instances.
//
// Read-only queries are organized into focused domain interfaces:
// [PlayerReader], [BattlefieldReader], [ResolutionReader], [TurnReader],
// [CombatReader], [TrackerReader], and [StackReader], which compose into [GameReader].
//
// Spell definitions can use OnlyDuring to restrict casting to one or more turn steps.
// Game checks the restriction before choices and payment. Copies of stack spells
// and spell resolution do not repeat the casting check.
//
// Use [SetBasePowerToughness] with [Until] to set captured base values.
// [SetBasePower] changes only base power. Bonuses and counters still apply. [TargetOtherThanSource] excludes the
// source from a typed permanent target.
//
// Use [Activate] with [Mana] costs and [Until] with [ModifyPT] of [This]
// for a temporary source bonus. Each resolution adds a separate bonus to
// the original permanent. A returned card does not receive that bonus.
// Use a typed target with [WithTargets] for a targeted bonus.
// [ValueAtResolution] captures X when the bonus starts. A blocking restriction
// belongs to the target filter; it does not end a bonus after resolution.
//
// # Engine Principles & Invariants
//
//   - Pure Queries: Readers and query methods never mutate game state or consume RNG.
//   - Clone Isolation: Cloned games ([Game.Clone]) must have strictly independent
//     state for tree search and AI simulation; mutations in one game never affect another.
//   - Transactional Cost Payments: Spell casting and ability activations verify and pay
//     costs atomically on an isolated clone before committing to the live game state.
//   - Durable Incarnations: Battlefield permanents track a unique incarnation ID
//     independent of their physical card UUID to prevent leave-and-return reference confusion.
//
// Draw-step replacements use [Static] with [SkipDrawStepForLife]. The rule
// follows the current controller and remains active only while the source has
// the ability. A pending gain keeps the player who skipped the step.
//
// Use [ChooseRandomPermanent] with [MatchingPermanents] to save a random
// battlefield reference. Use [TapSubject] with [From] to tap that reference.
// An empty collection does not consume a random value.
// Use [Until] with [GrantKeywordModification] and CantRegenerate for a
// prohibition that lasts until end of turn, even after its source leaves.
//
// Use [MultiplyValues] to multiply two resolution values. Procrastinate uses
// twice the announced X with [AddCountersTo] after [TapSubject].
//
// Use [ManaValueOf] to read a permanent through its typed reference. Use
// [SnapshotNumber] before [Destroy] when a later instruction needs that value.
// The saved number remains available after the permanent leaves.
// Swords to Plowshares saves [PowerOf] and [ControllerOf] before [Exile],
// then uses the saved values with [GainLifeFor]. Exile metadata stays distinct
// from destruction metadata when effects are combined.
// Use [SnapshotPlayer] with [ControllerOf] to save its controller before
// destruction. Crumble combines both snapshots with [DestroyWithoutRegeneration]
// and [GainLifeFor]; the saved controller gains life even if destruction fails.
//
// Use [WhenEvent] with [Enters] and [TapSubject] of [AttachedPermanent]
// to tap an enchanted permanent on entry. The attachment is read at resolution;
// a departed source uses its last attachment and cannot follow a new incarnation.
//
// [AttachedBecomesTapped] saves the event permanent before trigger placement.
// Read it with [From] so attachment changes cannot redirect the effect.
//
// Targeted destruction uses [Destroy] with a typed permanent target. Declare
// that target with [WithTargets] on the spell, mode, trigger, or activation.
// The target filter supplies the restriction; the action allows regeneration.
// Use [UnlessPaid] with [You] and [Destroy] of [This] for a granted
// upkeep payment. The trigger keeps its controller and source incarnation.
// Land destruction uses [IsLand] with the same target and action constructors.
// To destroy all lands, use [DestroyEach] with [MatchingPermanents] and [IsLand].
// Use [HasSubType] for a land subtype. Combine [IsCreature] and
// [HasColorFilter] with [And] to restrict destruction by creature color.
// Combine type filters with [Or] in one collection to destroy each matching
// permanent once. Separate destruction actions can consume extra shields and
// expose intermediate states to triggers.
// The collection is selected at resolution and does not include phased permanents.
// Use [DestroyEachWithoutRegeneration] when the instruction forbids regeneration.
// This restriction applies to the action and does not change permanent keywords.
//
// Use [CantBeBlocked] with [Until] for a temporary blocking restriction.
// It uses combat rules, so ability removal does not erase the restriction.
// The subject keeps its captured incarnation; source departure does not end it.
// Use [Activate] with [Costs] and [WithTargets] for tap-cost blocking effects.
// Put power limits in the target filter. Later power changes do not end the effect.
//
// Use [RemovePermanentFromCombat] with a typed reference to remove combat
// membership. An attacker stays blocked when its last blocker is removed.
//
// Use [GrantLandPlays] to add to a player's land allowance for this turn.
// Grants accumulate and remain separate in cloned games. The action does not
// play a land or change land timing. Explore grants the allowance before drawing.
//
// Use [Until] with [ModifyEachPT] for a temporary collection boost.
// [ControlledPermanents] with [IsCreature] selects your creatures at resolution.
// Later entries and returned cards do not receive the boost.
